# IBM_DS_certificate

This is officially my first Python & Git assignment.
Thanks to IBM Data Science Certificate program. I learned the languages, OS tools, and libraries commonly used for Data Science. 
I also enjoyed playing with Markdown on Jupyter Notebook. Some key Markdowns I use include:
  1. Create titles in a Markdown cell, i.e. H1 = #, H2 = ##, H3 = ###, etc.
  2. Create plain text in a Markdown cell by just typing in the cell
  3. Create ordered list in a Markdown cell by adding 1, 2, 3, ... in front of the text
  4. Create table in a Markdown cell using | and ---
  5. Simple arithmetic expressions, such as (3*4)+5
  6. Convert minutes to hours

Github didn't come in as handy but I managed it by watching some extra learning videos. 
I am now comfortable with Create a New Repositary, Clone a Repositary to Local Folder using local working directory on Terminal, Download Jupyter Notebook and upload it to the repository, and so on.

This is such an amazing learning experience for someone with no prior experience. I am looking forward to more future projects.
